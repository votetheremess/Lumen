# Launch the frontend with full logging from both the Rust frontend and
# the Vulkan layer going to the same file, tee'd to your terminal.
#
# Always performs pre-flight cleanup (stale processes + socket) and an
# after-exit cleanup (kill the frontend we launched, remove our socket),
# so repeated runs don't leave garbage behind.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run.sh               # info level everywhere
#   ./scripts/run.sh debug         # layer + rust at debug
#   ./scripts/run.sh trace         # everything loud
